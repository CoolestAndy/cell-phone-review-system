## Proposal

With the advancement of technology, cell phones have become very popular, and the design of cell phones has become more diverse. When choosing a cell phone, people will consider many factors, such as price, performance and appearance, and try to compare these factors with other brands. In order to help customers decide which cell phone to buy, we decide to build a cell phone review system, which allows users to search the reviews of other customers.

The similar web site is <https://www.phonearena.com>. We use 1.4 million cell phone reviews dataset on Kaggle to build our project. The dateset can be found on <https://www.kaggle.com/masaladata/14-million-cell-phone-reviews>. In this dataset, it includes 11 fields, including `phone_url`, `date`, `language`, `country`, `source`, `domain`, `score`, `score_max`, `extract`, `author` and `product`. These different elements will form diversified cell phone reviews which can help people choose the phone that works best for them from different views.

Besides, we have more interactions in this system like: log in and log out, give "likes" to interested phones, and write down their own cell phone reviews.
